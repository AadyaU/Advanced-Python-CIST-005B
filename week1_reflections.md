Reflecting on my journey with Python, I’ve taken Computer Science Principles and gained experience with Python Turtle. I’m fluent with basic concepts such as variables, loops, and functions, and I’m eager to dive into more advanced topics. Learning about object-oriented programming, data structures, and libraries like NumPy and Pandas is next on my list, and I’m excited about the new challenges and opportunities these will bring.
